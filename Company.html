            <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 16px;">A Dummy Studios was founded in 2018 in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, by a group of seven college friends. With the dream of creating games that combine engaging gameplay and diverse artistic visions, our purpose is clear. From the beginning, we have fostered an environment of mutual respect and appreciation for the team's opinions. This is reflected in the distinct artistic visions of each project and in daily feedback. We believe that individual stories contribute significantly to the richness of our games.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 16px;">In our vision, gameplay, the individual experience of each player, and level design are a cohesive set, living in harmony and serving as the pillars of a great experience. We consider games to be the most magical aspect of art today, as they directly engage people with art, where the creator's vision and the player's perspective collide.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 16px;">Currently, three founding members work tirelessly to materialize the best experiences for our audience. Committed to evolving and innovating, we maintain a passion for games and respect for the diversity of perspectives as fundamental pillars. We look forward to sharing our creations, bringing entertainment and excitement to every player.</p>
